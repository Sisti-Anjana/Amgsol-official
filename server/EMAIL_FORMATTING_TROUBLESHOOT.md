## ðŸš¨ If Still Not Working:

### Alternative Email Services (if Gmail issues persist):

1. **Update server.js to use different service:**
   ```javascript
   const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
     host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
     port: 587,
     secure: false,
     auth: {
       user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
       pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
     },
   });
   ```

2. **Try with Outlook/Hotmail:**
   ```javascript
   service: 'outlook'
   // or
   service: 'hotmail'
   ```

### Manual Email Verification:

If you want to verify the exact HTML being generated:

1. **Check server logs** when forms are submitted
2. **View generated HTML files** from preview script
3. **Copy HTML** and send manually to test formatting
4. **Use email testing tools** like Litmus or Email on Acid

- Both HTML and plain text versions are sent for maximum compatibility
- All emails include clickable links and professional formatting
